This program is licensed under the zlib license. See the LICENSE
file for more info. I chose this license to try and stay out of the license
quagmire of GPL2 vs GPL3, etc that surrounds some aspects of open source Java
implementations. Basically it means you an use and modify it as you like as
long as you aknowledge that it was I who did (most of) the work.
